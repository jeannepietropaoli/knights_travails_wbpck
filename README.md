A knight in chess can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess board from any other square on the board, given enough turns (donâ€™t believe it? See this animation). Its basic move is two steps forward and one step to the side. It can face any direction.

The goal is to build a function findShortestPath that shows the shortest possible way of a knight to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

The board could be a 2-dimensional coordinates. The function would therefore look like:

findShortestPath([0,0],[1,2]) ==> [[0,0],[1,2]]
findShortestPath([0,0],[3,3]) ==> [[0,0],[1,2],[3,3]]
findShortestPath([3,3],[0,0]) ==> [[3,3],[1,2],[0,0]]

Knight class (and findShortestPath method) can be found in the src/modules folder inside the 'Knight.js' file.
Gameboard class can be found in the same directory inside the 'Gameboard.js' file.

## Skills to practice

- Creating classes (constructor, parameters, getters, setters and methods)
- Implement a graph abstract data structure
- Practice and choose the best fitted graph search algorithms, Breadth First Search (BFS) in that case

## Features

- Simple UI with :
  - chess gameboard
  - position of the knight
  - target position of the knight
  - shortest path from initial position of the knight to the target
  - number of moves necessary

## Features to come

- improve UI :
  - design
  - input of the user to decide :
    - position of the knight
    - target of the knight

## Test

- Simple script that creates a game board and a knight
- Call the findTheShortesPath function with the position of the knight and target position as arguments
- Call the displayPath and printPath functions to display the path on the chessBoard and describe it in a short sentence
